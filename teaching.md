# Teaching Experience

Here are some of the courses I have assisted or taught:

- **MATH 160: Survey of Calculus** – Teaching Assistant, Fall 2024, University of Idaho
- **MATH 175: Calculus II** – Grading Assistant, Spring 2025, University of Idaho
- **Introductory Programming** – Lab Instructor during undergraduate studies at Rajarata University

I enjoy helping students understand core concepts and apply math in real-world problems.
