# Hello, I'm Nethmi 👋

I’m a first-year graduate student at the University of Idaho. I hold a BSc (Hons) in Industrial Mathematics from Rajarata University of Sri Lanka, where I studied Mathematics, Computer Science, and Chemistry.

I'm passionate about applied mathematics, data analysis, and scientific research.
